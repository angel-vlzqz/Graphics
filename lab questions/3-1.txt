For rendering the floor, I believe that the best aproach would be
utilizing a container with a wood texture in order to simulate the floor.
For the walls, I would use another container with a drywall texture to properly
simulate the walls. Then, the process would be repeated for the ceiling, and
other flat surfaces. For the objects, I would use a combination of containers
with textures that simulate the objects, and 2D models that are placed in the
scene.
