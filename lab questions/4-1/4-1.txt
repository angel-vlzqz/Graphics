In support of Project 4: Carefully read the description of Project 4. Choose 
an object from your scene and describe which transformations you would apply 
to the initial geometric representation in order to produce the desired shape. 
Provide a screenshot of your implementation. Solicit feedback from the 
instructor and peers.

In Project 4, I chose to create a simple scene of a tv stand and a tv. I wanted
to create a tv stand that had a simple design and was easy to create. For the
transformations, I utilized a perspective projection matrix to create the
effect of the tv stand being in a 3D space. Using this, I was able to create
the general shape of the tv stand.
