	1.	Vertex Data: We set up vertices with positions and texture coordinates.
	2.	Loading the Texture: We use the stb_image library to load image data and generate an OpenGL texture.
	3.	Shaders: We pass the texture coordinates from the vertex shader to the fragment shader, which applies the texture to each fragment.
	4.	Rendering: Bind the texture and draw elements to apply texture mapping to your shape.

After compiling and running, this code will map your texture onto a quad.
