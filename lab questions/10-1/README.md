1. In the specific context of graphics workloads, performing cycle-accurate 
simulations are even more demanding due to the high number of triangles that have 
to be shaded, lighted and textured to compose a single frame. As a result, 
simulating a few minutes of a video game sequence is extremely time-consuming.

2. To model the most important effects of smoke, we need two extra fluid 
variables: the temperature T of the air and the concentration s of smoke 
particlesâ€”what we actually can see. Similar phenomena, such as vapor, can be 
modeled in much the same way.

3. Interactive rigid body simulation is an important part of many modern computer 
tools, which no authoring tool nor game engine can do without. Such 
high-performance computer tools open up new possibilities for changing how 
designers, engineers, modelers and animators work with their design problems.

4. Fluid can be simulated from 2 viewpoints, Lagrangian or Eulerian.
In the Lagrangian viewpoint, we simulate the fluid as discrete blobs
of fluid. Each particle has various properties, such as mass, velocity, etc. The benefit of this approach is that conservation of mass
comes easily.

5. We use a staggered grid discretization of
the velocity and pressure equations as in [Fedkiw, et al.
2001;Foster and Metaxas 1997;Griebel, et al. 1998]. This
means that pressure, temperature, and water content are
defined at the center of voxels while velocity is defined on
the faces of the voxels. Not only does this method reduce
numerical dissipation as mentioned by Fedkiw et al., but as
Griebel et al. explain, it prevents possible pressure
oscillations that can arise with collocated grids (in which all
variables are defined at cell centers).
