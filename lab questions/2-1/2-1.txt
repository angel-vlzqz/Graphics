what makes an object more difficult to recreate in openGL? What types of objects are easier to recreate in OpenGL? Provide an example for each, and explain why.

Typically, curved and animated objects are more difficult to recreate in OpenGL
than simple objects. This is because OpenGL is a low-level API that is designed
to render simple shapes and objects. Curved objects require more vertices, 
which can be difficult and tedious to create. Animated objects require more
complex transformations and calculations, which can be challenging to implement
in OpenGL.

curved object in OpenGL:
A sphere is an example of a curved object that is more difficult to recreate in
OpenGL. 

void drawSphere(float radius, int slices, int stacks) {
    glPushMatrix();
    glTranslatef(0.0, 0.0, 0.0);
    glutSolidSphere(radius, slices, stacks);
    glPopMatrix();
}

animated object in OpenGL:
A rotating cube is an example of an animated object that is more difficult to
recreate in OpenGL.

void drawRotatingCube(float angle) {
    glPushMatrix();
    glRotatef(angle, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0);
    glutSolidCube(1.0);
    glPopMatrix();
}
