Use in a Game

Scene Idea: A Mystical Forest with Interactive Light Puzzles
	•	Gameplay: The player must navigate through the forest by solving light-based puzzles. Reflective surfaces like mirrors and crystals can guide beams of light to specific targets, unlocking pathways. The scene features dynamic lighting and fog to create an immersive atmosphere.
	•	Interaction: Players can manipulate objects like mirrors, rotate beams of light, and activate hidden mechanisms.


Use in a Simulation

Scene Idea: A Space Exploration Training Simulator
	•	Simulation Purpose: This scene mimics a space station orbiting a distant planet. Trainees navigate the station, repair damaged modules, and interact with control panels while observing realistic space lighting and physics.
	•	Educational Value: Focuses on zero-gravity movement, understanding orbital mechanics, and multitasking under pressure.
