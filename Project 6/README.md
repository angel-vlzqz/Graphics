# Project 6: Specular Lighting, Objects, Illumination and Shaders

## Description
This project aims to expand our knowledge of shaders by implimenting 8 cubes of different shiness values and then display the shiness value beneath the cube. This project utilizes phong lighting model to combine ambient, diffuse, and spectral lighting.

## Requirments
This project utilizes GLEW, GLFW, and Freetype.

For installation run: sudo apt-get install libglew-dev freeglut3-dev libfreetype6-dev

## Building and running the Project
1. Run the following command to build the project `g++ -I/usr/include/freetype2 ShinyCubes.cpp -o run -lGLU -lGL -lGLEW -lglfw -lfreetype`
2. To run the project run the following command `./run`
