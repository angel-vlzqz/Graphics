Unless you are Ricardo Citro, you should not be reading this document.

If you are Ricardo Citro, then all the necessary dependencies should be on
your system, which means that running these files should be a breeze.

When running the 2D Sierpinski, compile the file by typing the following
command into your terminal:
`g++ Sierpinski2D.cpp -o Sierpinski2D -lglut -lGLU -lGL`

A similar command can be used to compile the 3d Sierpinski file:
`g++ Sierpinski3D.cpp -o Sierpinski3D -lglut -lGLU -lGL`

If `./Sierpinski2D` or `./Sierpinski3D` do not work when attempting to run the
program, physically go to the working directory and double click the program
to run it.
